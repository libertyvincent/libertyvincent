Hello, 

Special thanks to freecodecamp, Freemote and Git Hub. 

I'd like to find a way to contribute, once all this work pays off, even just a little bit. 

Anyone reading this should know that Git, and the two courses I just mentioned have helped me more than anything I can think of right now. 

But then again, I'm considering creating a coders Anonymous group on facebook. 

Love you, 

Tea Pots, Sturdy Stone Structures, "{{ & }}" The Orange
